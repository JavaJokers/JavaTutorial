Lesson 3 - Variables

Variables are like boxes. The box stores whatever you put in it, and you can take it out again. Or, if you want a different explanation, it's pretty much algebra, but X isn't always called X, and it's not just numbers.

You can define a variable like this:

var myvariable = "This is the value stored in myvariable!";
