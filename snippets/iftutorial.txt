Lesson 4 - Conditional Statements

A simple conditional statement looks like this:

if(name == "Java Jokers"){
    System.out.println("Nice name!");
}

This code checks if a variable, called "name", is equal to the text "Java Jokers". Pretty much just algebra. Then, if it's equal, it prints text to the screen.
